This is for function-classes.

They are defined like this::

    def MyFClass(arg1, arg2):
        def addargs(arg3):
            return arg1 + arg2 + arg3
        ...define more procedures...
        return gendispatch(MyFClass, locals())

Note that these fclasses should not have any extraneous local variables;
all top-level local variables should be functions meant to be called,
or arguments passed.

An fclass is intantiated like so::

    mything = MyFClass(1, 2)

Getters are automatically generated. They are of the form "_<arg>".

All functions are called like this::

    mything("<fn_name>")(<args>)

For example::

    mything("addargs")(3)  # returns 1+2+3 = 6
    mything("_arg1")()  # returns arg1 which is 1

    Generate the dispatch function.
    This is for use in a class-function (something inspired by chapter 2 of SICP)
    It generates the dispatch() routine which is to be returned.

    Note: This should be used like so::

        return gendispatch(<parent function object>, locals())

    The parent function and its locals have to be passed because of technical constraints.

    Due to how inheritance is implemented, you must not name a local (procedure or not)
    "_exposed", "_custgetters" or "_getargs".

    Unless otherwise specified (by passing no_gen_getters as True)
    Getters are automatically generated: they are named "_<var>". If such a function
    has already been defined, it is not overwritten.

    Overlapping definitions will favour base2.
    Beware the order of arguments though; it's base1, then base2. Overlapping

    Custom getters are carried down; automatically generated ones will be
    regenerated (but are of course functionally identical; the code is also
    identical. The object will be different, if that somehow matters...)

    "extargs" should have arguments for "extend"
